# Template for OGC Blog

This is a template blog post. You can delete the content and start from scratch.

## Metadata

Between the pair of three hyphens on the top of this file are `title:`,
`author:`, and `pubdate`. These are fields that the site needs to:

1. Know what the title of the article is
2. Know the author of the article, and
3. Know the date at which the article is published.

Of these three, `pubdate` is important as a planned site feature is "Recent blog
posts", which will make use of `pubdate` to sort the ... most recent ... posts.

## Writing a New Post

Posts on this blog are written in a format called Markdown.
[Learn about Markdown here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). This
makes writing a post with basic formatting very simple.

What are the steps for making a new post?

1. Log into GitHub. If you don't have an account, it's free.
2. Go to
   [the code for the site, linked here](https://github.com/revslaughter/aug-blog/tree/main/_posts)
3. Click 'add file' in the upper right hand corner of the `_posts` folder, and
   select 'create new file'
4. Name the file. Make sure it doesn't have spaces, and ends with `.md`
5. Write your post! Go get 'em, maestro.
6. At the bottom of the editing page, you can write a message to me about the
   post. If you're not done, it's ok - it doesn't have to be published right
   away.
7. Select "Create a **new branch** for this commit and start a pull request",
   and click 'Commit changes'.

This will create a request for me to update the site. If you're done, I'll
complete the request and your post will be published on the site!

After everything is merged to the `main` branch, Netlify will detect the new
version and build the site anew. You will then be able to view your new post on
the website after a short delay.

If you have any questions get me on the Discord `@revslaughter` or email me at
jmslaughter85@outlook.com, or via GitHub.
